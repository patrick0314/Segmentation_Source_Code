Normalized cuts is an image segmentation algorithm which uses a  graph theoretic framework to solve the problem of perceptual grouping. The algorithm was developed by Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik back in 1997, and is one of those rare algorithms that has repeatedly stood the test of time.

The code written here is a Matlab implementation of the algorithm, written as a partial fulfillment of the Digital Image Processing course at International Institiute of Information Technology, Bangalore.

####Instruction
This code is to implement the segmentation method desribed in: 

It is written in MATLAB with C++ mex files, and has been tested under windows and linux. 

To reproduce the results reported in our paper, first download the benchmark dataset BSDS300 (including "Images" and "Human segmentations") from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/ and then set the BSDS300 directory path to a variable "bsdsRoot" in "demo_SAS_BSDS.m". 

We remark that part of this code is modified from the code of Tae Hoon Kim et al. for their CVPR10 paper.
